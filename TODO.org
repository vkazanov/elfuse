* Possible improvements

** Instead of using Emacs signals for error reporting it might be possible to just return keywords such as :ENOSYS

   ...while still handling non-local exits

** Multiple FUSE threads with a single request queue

** Get rid of all the boilerplate code - there must be a better way of declaring handlers

** Install/drop the signal handler when starting/stoping Elfuse?
